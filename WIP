WIP notes for adding ALWAYS DEFERRED option for CONSTRAINTs and CONSTRAINT TRIGGERs
===================================================================================

 - add ALWAYS DEFERRED syntax in src/backend/parser/gram.y (DONE)

   (the existing NOT DEFERRABLE == ALWAYS IMMEDIATE, so we don't add that)

 - add alwaysdeferred field to several structs -- wherever initdeferred
   is defined, basically (DONE)

 - add conalwaysdeferred column to pg_constraints

 - in src/backend/commands/trigger.c modify places where all_isdeferred
   and all_isset are used (DONE)

 - add AFTER_TRIGGER_ALWAYSDEFERRED for AfterTriggerSharedData's
   ats_event (struct) and fill it in in AfterTriggerSaveEvent(), that
   way afterTriggerCheckState() can check this

   (DONE)

 - add docs (DONE)

 - add tests (TBD)
